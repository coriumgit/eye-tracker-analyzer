what we learned from a month of EDF conversion issues
-----------------------------------------------------
There are two ways of converting the edf data to matlab structs/files: 

The easy way:
------------
1) Convert your file to a .asc file using the EL supplied sofware "visual edf2asc".
2) once you have your .asc file you can use the function read_eyelink_asc supplied here in the folder
------------------------------------------------------

The hard way:         ( direct edf>mat convertion, takes about 1/11 of the time to convert) 
------------
use our readEDF function, written in c:
If you're using win 64 MATLAB 64 you can most probably just use the ready mex (readEDF.mexw64) file (only go through stages d,h)
If not (or this fails) you need to compile the .c file for yourself:
if you  have an installed (and working) matlab compiler (type mex -setup to see) try going through stages d,g,h.
ELSE: stages a-h.


1) in order to convert edf's efficiently one needs to use a mex compiled file from readEDF.c, this compilation being OS and architecture (32 vs 64) specific.
2) in order to make Shlomit's original readEDF.c file compile, a few things are needed:
	a) Matlab with appropriate, OS compatible SDK, and visual C++ libraries.
	b) once matlab and the SDK and C++ are installed, one needs to define the compiler for use with matlab, this is done by typing mex -setup in the command line.

	c) the compiler that worked for us is 
		[1] Microsoft Software Development Kit (SDK) 7.1 in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0
		even though it shows the x86 path, its was still perfectly fine for  our settings (win64)
//////////////////////////			d) the changes done to the original readEDF.c file were as following: 
/////////ignore this		   	1) move all variables declarations to the very beginning of the script (to lines 60-100 approx.)
///////////				2) make the  "int outDimsMessages" declaration a set value (1,20000) instead of relying on numMessages.
///////////////////////////			3) perhaps other minor changes
	d) download all the files in this folder to a local folder, along with your desired edf file, and make it your current folder 
	e) after installing a working matlab compiler replace your mexopts.bat with the attached mexopts.bat (Not sure this is necessary, note that this mex is overrwritten when the compiler is selected with the 'mex -setup'
	f) make sure all is well defined and all necessary "includes" are working, this  requires the files "mex.h" and "mgl.h" from the folder being accessible.
	g) (cross your fingers and) compile (in the command type : mex readEDF.c) 
	h) (pray and) use readEDF('youredffilename.edf')


---------------------
if all this doesn't work, return to conducting a thourough check of comparison between the original readEDF.c and the current one. 
If STILL fails, contact 	roy.amit@mail.huji.ac.il 

See comments in the readEDF.c beginning!
